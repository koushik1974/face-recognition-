## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-app.git
cd face-recognition-app
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

Make sure you have Python 3.7‚Äì3.11 installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è `dlib` can be tricky to install on some systems. On Windows, you may need CMake and Visual Studio Build Tools. See [dlib install help](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/01/22/install-dlib-easy-complete-guide/).

3. **Add known face images:**

Place clear, front-facing images into the `images/` folder. The filename will be used as the label.
